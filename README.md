# Fitness Calorie & Duration Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the number of calories burned, based on the estimated duration of the workout OR recommends a duration of workout to meet a desired calorie output.

## Model Performance Summary

We trained and evaluated several regression models to predict two targets:

- Calories Burned
- Workout Duration (minutes)

Our final model uses **Gradient Boosting** (XGBoost) and achieves strong predictive performance across both metrics.

## Performance Visualization:
